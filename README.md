# Eneroth Axes Overlay

Useful to keep yourself or your clients oriented when displaying a model.

Similar to Eneroth North Arrow but aimed for technical modeling rather than
architectural modeling.

Found in the **Overlays panel** in SketchUp 2023 and later.
Activated from Extensions > Eneroth Axes Overlays in older versions.
